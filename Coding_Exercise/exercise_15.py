# Task Completion Tracker
# Instructions

# You’re building a simple task tracker for a to-do app. Whenever a user completes tasks, your app should mark them as done.

# Tasks:
#   - Define a function mark_completed_tasks that accepts a list of task names.
#   - Iterate through the list using a for loop, and update the format like "Completed:  {task}".
#   - Return a new list with the updated task strings.

tasks = ["Buying Groceries", "Paying Bills"]


for task in tasks:
    print(f"Completed: {task}")
