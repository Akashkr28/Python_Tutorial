# Smart Token Dispenser
# You are developing a Smart Token Dispenser system, like those found in banks or clinics. This system reset counters based on user activity and needs to run until manually stopped.

# Tasks:
# 1. Create an infinite generator function called token_dispenser(start=1).
# 2. On each call to next(), it should yield the current token number and increment it.
# 3. If a value is passed to the generator using send(), the generator should reset the token number to that new value.
# 4. The generator should handle the .close() method gracefully and print "Dispenser closed." when it is closed.

"""
    Infinite generator that simulates a token dispenser.
    
    - Yields incrementing token numbers starting from `start`.
    - Accepts input via `send()` to optionally reset the counter to a new value.
    - Gracefully stops if `close()` is called.
